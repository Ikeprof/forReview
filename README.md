Ikecode is called on server poll.  It is the engine that calls  the other routines.  It has the routines for social mob behavior, mob migration, custom spells etc.

Guardian is the combat pet code. The combat pets use existing skills that don't apply to pets to hold information.  So skill #1013 (I don't remember what that is) holds the last command issued by the player via his wand).

WispUpdate is the light token that follows the player around.
